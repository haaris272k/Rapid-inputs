# Rules

-> A player can choose as many rounds as he wants to play in a game.

-> Player will be assigned to a random alphabet.

-> The main goal is to give input as a name of any place starting with the same alphabet assigned to the player.

-> CPU will also choose a place starting with the ending letter of the guess made by the player. (CPU will always be 100% efficient)

-> The player should give an input before the timer goes off else the game will get over and no points will be awarded.
